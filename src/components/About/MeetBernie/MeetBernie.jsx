        <p>With over two decades of experience in professional dog grooming, Bernie is a certified master groomer with a passion for teaching and sharing her expertise.</p>
        <p>After running her own successful grooming salon for 15 years, Bernie decided to focus on education, helping aspiring groomers develop the skills and confidence needed to excel in this rewarding field.</p>
        <p>Leicester Dog Grooming Courses is passionate about training and qualifications in addition to raising public awareness for appropriately trained staff and tomorrow’s groomers. She is committed to professional development and cares about standards and quality of care for both student and animal welfare.</p>
        <p>She is qualified to teach and highly qualified in the grooming industry. Unfortunately, the grooming industry is not regulated and there are many groomers who claim to teach and are unqualified not only to teach but are unqualified themselves. This leaves the industry in some areas open to sub-standard training, safety, and animal welfare.</p>
        <p>The aims here at Leicester Dog Grooming Courses are to have input into achieving success for you the student by giving thorough knowledge of dog grooming by promoting a professional and kind approach in a fun but relaxed environment. All training is to City & Guilds and TPG level and standards. Not only do we offer dog grooming courses, but we also offer dog grooming in Leicester.</p>
        <p>It will also further the advancement for future qualification of the City & Guild Level 3 and TPG or setting up your own grooming business or employment.</p>
        <p>Our team is headed by founder Bernie Broadway (ICMG). We pride ourselves on kind, gentle handling of our customers’ dogs with a no crate system and high standards of excellence in grooming care.</p>
        <p>Bernie’s membership with the International Pet Groomer (IPG) has progressed her to almost completion of the prestigious qualification, the International Certification of Master Groomers (ICMG) and hopes to bring it to her students in 2016.</p>
