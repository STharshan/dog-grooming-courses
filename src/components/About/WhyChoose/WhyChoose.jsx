          <h3>Qualified private dog grooming course</h3>
          <p>
            the dog grooming field is not well regulated and there are plenty of dog groomers
            who claim to be able to teach grooming but donâ€™t have the capacity. We are the only
            private dog grooming course service that is qualified and accredited by the IPG, City and
            Guilds and other organisations. Our courses and papers are recognised by these and other
            licensing bodies.

          <h3>Speciality courses</h3>
          <p>
            we have a variety of courses designed to improve certain aspects of dog grooming
            as our students might prefer. We also have different courses for specific breeds which
            are available to students who would like to gain extra experience in certain breeds.
